USING POSTIT!

PostIt! is commonly used by non-technical users to create surveys and questionnaires. However; displaying these forms is up to the developer. Surveys are stored as XML files, allowing developers to display the form in any way they want. That means surveys generated with PostIt could be used with PHP, Java, AJAX, Flex, or any other language capable of reading XML.

The system also ships with a ColdFusion CFC that reads survey XML. This shortcut for CF developers was created to help developers quickly create display pages. A demo is provided in the download along with documentation.
